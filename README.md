### Summary
Pulsate is designed to help you manage your medical closet. Instead of using outdated spreadsheets that require lots of manual updating, our service allows your employees to "checkout" items from your closet, automatically updating your stock. This is done via QR codes associated with each product. Users can scan the QR code and select the expiration dates associated with the items they are taking, and that's it! Once a product's stock is marked as low or an item from that stock is close to expiring, you'll receive a notification via email and through the application to ensure you are always up-to-date with the status of your inventory.
